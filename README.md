# Horiseon Client Accessibility Project

## Refractored client code to meet accessibility standards and optimize for search engines

I needed to organize and consolidate the code in both HTML and the CSS files. There was also no comments to explain what was going on or what function the code had. I did this so that it is also easier to read the code and organized semantically, as well as adding "alt" tags for better accessibility. Below are some commits explaining what I did. 

1. Organized html and added comments - I got rid of some divs and added sections instead. I also organized it so it followed correct semantic order and follows a logical structure. I added comments to the elements to explain what they are. Lastly, I added "alt" tags to the images, and added descripton where needed.

2. consolidated css and added comments - I organized it so it follows the semantic order and added comments explaining where its adding styles in html. I also consolidated css selectors and properties that were reptetive, so that instead they are grouped to  a class instead or to one selector. 

3. added readme file - created a README file for the project, and gave a brief description of what i did. I also explained my commits as seen above.
